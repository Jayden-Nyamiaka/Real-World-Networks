# Real-World-Networks
Examining the structure and economics of real-world networks using mathematical analysis, graph theory, and probability. Leverages Python to model, analyze, and simulate complex network dynamics, including social networks, web structures, and information cascades, with a focus on both theoretical foundations and practical applications.

## Overview
Networks are an integral part of our everyday lives, from the web and social platforms to the internet infrastructure. This repository dives into the "big ideas" behind networks, uncovering their structure, behavior, and dynamics. Through advanced Python programming, this project applies mathematical and computational techniques to answer questions such as:
- What do real-world networks look like, and why do they exhibit similar structural patterns?  
- How do phenomena like memes and information cascades spread across networks?  
- What mechanisms power search engines, computational advertising, and network optimization?  

## Key Features
- **Graph Theory in Action**: Utilize Python libraries like NetworkX to model and visualize network structures.  
- **Mathematical Rigor**: Incorporates advanced analyses using graph theory and probabilistic models to study network dynamics.
